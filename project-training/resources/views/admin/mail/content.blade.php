<p>Hi, Sir</p>
<p>We regret to inform you that we will not be able to respect the deadline
    previously agreed for the delivery of your order. Our supplier has warned us today
    that they are experiencing supply problems, which will result in a delay in our production chain.
    We count on your understanding and thank you for your patience.</p>

<strong>Thank you Sir. :)</strong>
